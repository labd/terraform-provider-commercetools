# commercetools_state (Resource)

The commercetools platform allows you to model states of certain objects, such as orders, line items, products, reviews, and payments to define finite state machines reflecting the business logic you'd like to implement.

See also the [State API Documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/states)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "commercetools_state" "review_unreviewed" {
  key = "review-unreviewed"
  type = "ReviewState"
  name = {
      en = "Unreviewed"
  }
  description = {
    en = "Not reviewed yet"
  }
  initial = true
  roles = ["ReviewIncludedInStatistics"]
}


# State with transitions specified:

resource "commercetools_state" "product_for_sale" {
  key = "product-for-sale"
  type = "ProductState"
  name = {
      en = "For Sale"
  }
  description = {
    en = "Regularly stocked product."
  }
  initial = true
  transitions = ["${commercetools_state.product_clearance.key}"]
}

resource "commercetools_state" "product_clearance" {
  key = "product-clearance"
  type = "ProductState"
  name = {
      en = "On Clearance"
  }
  description = {
    en = "The product line will not be ordered again."
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **key** (String) A unique identifier for the state
- **type** (String) [StateType](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/states#statetype)

### Optional

- **description** (Map of String) [LocalizedString](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/types#localizedstring)
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **initial** (Boolean) A state can be declared as an initial state for any state machine. When a workflow starts, this first state must be an initial state
- **name** (Map of String) [LocalizedString](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/types#localizedstring)
- **roles** (List of String) Array of [State Role](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/states#staterole)
- **transitions** (Set of String) Transitions are a way to describe possible transformations of the current state to other states of the same type (for example: Initial -> Shipped). When performing a transitionState update action and transitions is set, the currently referenced state must have a transition to the new state.
If transitions is an empty list, it means the current state is a final state and no further transitions are allowed.
If transitions is not set, the validation is turned off. When performing a transitionState update action, any other state of the same type can be transitioned to

### Read-Only

- **version** (Number)
