# Custom Types

Types define custom fields that are used to enhance resources as you need.
Since there is no model that fits all use-cases, we give you the possibility
to customize some resources, so that they fit your data model as close as
possible.

Use Types to model your own CustomFields on resources, like Category and
Customer.

In case you want to customize products, please use product types instead that
serve a similar purpose, but tailored to products.

 - product types are specialized to customize products.
 - types are used to customize other resources.

Also see the [type HTTP API documentation][commercetool-type].
